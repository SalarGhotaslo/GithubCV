## Summary

Former business analyst/project manager turned into an enthusiastic coder!
Having recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech) I have gained the skills to set me up to be a succesful developer.

I love the logic behind coding and visually being able to see how you can apply it to real world problems. My current strongest areas are using Ruby, Rails, Javascript and React native.

Feel free to contact me regarding any job opportunities!

## Skills

#### Analytical

I understand how to break problems down into small pieces and take a structured approach to solve them. I have transferred this skill into various coding projects, which has allowed me to debug code quickly and efficiently.

#### Team Player

I have learned to work both autonomously and collaboratively using both influence and compromise. I am willing to listen to team members and embrace their ideas, but also have the ability to influence to entertain different ways of thinking.

#### Adaptability

I have frequently changed the focus from one project to another at short notice; this allows me to thrive in fast-paced environments. When working as a project coordinator, project requirements would change weekly; therefore, I have learned to embrace change and become resilient.

#### University of Plymouth / College (September-2012 to September-2016)

## Summary

As a former business analyst, I had worked alongside other developers on various projects which started my fascination about coding and wanted to understand it more. I wanted to pursuit this interest further and have since graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech) where I have gained the skills to set me up to be a successful developer.

I love the logic behind coding and visually being able to see how you can apply it to real world problems. My current strongest areas are using Ruby, Rails, Javascript and React native.

From managing projects and analysing data, it's given me useful tools to bring a balanced mindset when working on projects. Both of these skills are invaluable in my journey of being a developer.

| [Guilt trip / Sloth](https://github.com/SalarGhotaslo/Guilt_Trip) | The app is designed to encourage you to reach your step goal set and tracked by the app. My main contributions were towards the logic using Javascript and the design.                                                                               | React native, Javascript, Expo, Jest |
| [Bank account](https://github.com/SalarGhotaslo/Bank_account.rb)  | Designed to allow customers to use usual bank account features such as credit/debiting an account and viewing the transactions. This was to focus purely on coding within Ruby.                                                                      | Ruby                                 |
| [Acebook-sholk](https://github.com/SalarGhotaslo/acebook-sholk)   | A Facebook clone where users can login, post messages and like each others posts. This helped me focus on CRUD principles and how this can be applied within rails and then change the needs of the website to meet the requirements we had set out. | Ruby on rails, Travis, Heroku        |

## Skills

#### Analytical

I understand how to break problems down into small pieces and take a structured approach to solve them. Having this structured approach has helped me save time in all of my coding projects as well as my efficiency in debugging.

#### Team Player

I have learned to work both autonomously and collaboratively using both influence and compromise. I am willing to listen to team members and embrace their ideas, but also have the ability to influence to entertain different ways of thinking. During one of my projects at Makers it really made me appreciate how important it is to stick to scrum practices, allowing the team to work better and more effectively.

#### Adaptability

I have frequently changed the focus from one project to another at short notice; this allows me to thrive in fast-paced environments. When working as a project coordinator, project requirements would change weekly; therefore, I have learned to embrace change and become resilient.

#### Self-led learner

I break problems down piece by piece and always have a good image of what clients/ businesses wants when an idea has been pitched. I am able to use my initiative to build on these ideas to produce meaningful work, using previous experience working as an analyst/project manager and online resources as my tools. I have been able to transfer this skill whilst studying at Makers Academy.
